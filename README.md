Hangman for the UCFK4

How to play:
Hangman is a game where you try to reveal a hidden word by guessing individual letters before a complete image of a person is formed. If you guess a letter correctly, all occurrences of this letter in the hidden word will be revealed. If you guess a letter incorrectly, then part of the image of the person will be revealed.
The game starts with the complete hangman visible onscreen. Press in the navswitch to begin the game! a short animation will play which shows all the different frames for the hangman character. Then, the length of the hidden word will flash onscreen.

The game is structured on two screens. Play starts on the alphabet screen, but by moving the navswitch up or down, you can change to the hidden word screen.
The alphabet screen starts off with the 26 letters of the alphabet displayed one character at a time. You can scroll between letters by moving the navswitch left or right. If you have already guessed a letter, then it will display as a '\_' blank space. If you're on this screen, then the blue LED indicator will turn on.
The hidden word screen starts off with one '\_' blank character per letter in the word, followed by a number, which tells you the length of the hidden word. You can scroll through these characters by moving the navswitch left or right. If you have correctly guessed a letter, then it will display in the correct place in the word, instead of a blank character.
Pressing Button 1 on the ucfk at any time will display your hangman person. The different frames look like this:

When this complete person is displayed on your screen, don't panic! you still have one last life lost. If you make one more incorrect guess, then you will lose!

When you make a guess, one of two things will happen. If the game flashes between a blank '\_' character and the character you guessed, then great job! you guessed a letter correctly. Try scrolling through the hidden word screen to see where the letter got revealed. If the screen flashes between your hangman lives screen and the letter you guessed, then sorry, you guessed incorrectly.
After this guess, the screen will go back to displaying the character you just guessed, now replaced with a '\_' character.

Once the game is won or lost the whole word will be displayed onscreen, before returning to the start screen. Press the navswitch in again to play a new game with a different word. Enjoy!
